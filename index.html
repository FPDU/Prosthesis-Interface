</h2>

<h3>
<a id="device-location" class="anchor" href="#device-location" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Device location</strong>
</h3>

<p>Where the medical devices for controlling the prosthesis and giving you a sense of touch are located. Some current prostheses use sensors on the skin surface. Using these prostheses does not require surgery. New prostheses may place medical devices inside the arm or in the back. These devices may be attached to muscles, nerves, or the spinal cord.</p>

<h3>
<a id="prosthesis-socket" class="anchor" href="#prosthesis-socket" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Prosthesis socket</strong>
</h3>

<p>The new prostheses may be attached to your body in different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some may use a typical socket or harness.</li>
<li>Some may use a more advanced harness. This harness would distribute the weight of the prosthesis around your arm, shoulder, and back.</li>
<li>Some may be attached using a surgery called “osseous integration.” The surgery would attach a post to your arm bone. You may be able to move your arm more freely, it may be easier to put the prosthesis on, and you may feel that the prosthesis attachment is more secure. You may have less pain and skin irritation. However, there is a risk of infection, the post might loosen or bend, and the bone could break.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="comfort" class="anchor" href="#comfort" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Comfort</strong>
</h3>

<p>You may feel no discomfort with some prostheses. With other prostheses you may feel some discomfort or pain.</p>
      
<h3>
<a id="ease-of-donning-and-doffing" class="anchor" href="#ease-of-donning-and-doffing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Ease of donning and doffing</strong>
</h3>

<p>How easy it is for you to put on and remove the prosthesis. Some new prostheses may take only a few seconds to put on. Others may take as much as a few minutes to put on.</p>
	  
<h3>
<a id="time-between-intention-to-move-and-actual-movement" class="anchor" href="#time-between-intention-to-move-and-actual-movement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Time between intention to move and actual movement</strong>
</h3>

<p>For some new prostheses, you will not notice a delay between when you want the prosthesis to move and when it moves. For some new prostheses, there may be a delay that is slightly noticeable. For some new prostheses, the delay might be as long as 2 seconds.</p>
	  
<h3>
<a id="arm-ownership" class="anchor" href="#arm-ownership" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Arm ownership</strong>
</h3>

<p>You may be more likely with some new prostheses to feel like your prosthesis is a part of your body. It might feel like it "belongs" to you. Because of this feeling, you may be more likely to forget that you have a prosthesis.</p>
