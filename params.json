{"name":"Sensation-features","tagline":"Sensation feature table","body":"##**Prosthesis Sensation Features**\r\n\r\n###**Sensory feedback**\r\nCurrent prostheses do not give you a sense of touch. Some new prostheses with implanted stimulators may:\r\n* Give you a sense of touch in your fingertips and palm. \r\n* Give you a sense of temperature in your fingertips and palm.\r\n* Let you feel where your fingers and wrist are when you move them.\r\n\r\n###**Intuitiveness of sensation**\r\nSome new prostheses may give you a sense of touch. However, where you feel the sense of touch may vary. \r\n* For some new prostheses, the feeling may be indirect. For example, you may feel touch on your upper arm when your prosthesis fingertip has touched something.\r\n* For other new prostheses, the feeling may be direct and intuitive. For example, you may feel the fingertip touch on your fingertip.\r\n\r\n###**Arm ownership**\r\nYou may be more likely with some new prostheses to feel like your prosthesis is a part of your body. It might feel like it \"belongs\" to you. Because of this feeling, you may be more likely to forget that you have a prosthesis.\r\n\r\n###**Recalibration frequency**\r\nYou may need to run a program so the prosthesis gives you the correct sense of touch. Some new prostheses may need to be recalibrated once per day or less. Other new prostheses may need to be recalibrated twice per day or more.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
